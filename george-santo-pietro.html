She and her co-host Pat Sajak have been a part of the programme for the past 40 years, which is a major event in and of itself.</p><p>The hostess of the game show Wheel of Fortune, Vanna, is a well-liked television personality. She has been in charge of solving the problems’ letters over the years.</p><h3>Vanna White’s love life explored</h3><p>When we shed some light on the TV star’s private life, we discover that Vanna has had a few well-known relationships when she was a cast member. She has been in a serious relationship with John Donaldson for the past ten years, and he has genuinely made her fall head over heels in love with him.</p><p>White dated actor-turned-Chippendales dancer John Gibson back in the 1980s. The two finally became engaged, but Gibson tragically died in an aircraft crash in 1986.<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/vannawhite-1-e1571768776740-1-0dde9601e8c4430f8eb519547d54546c-1-781x1024.jpg alt width=781 height=1024 sizes="(max-width: 781px) 100vw, 781px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“I heard from so many people who had suffered the same experience of losing someone instantaneously in an accident, and that really comforted me,” White later remarked to People magazine. I didn’t believe I was alone myself.</p><p>The Wheel of Fortune co-host continued living after that and got married to restaurant owner George Santo Pietro in 1990. In December 1990, they exchanged vows, and in November 2002, they filed for divorce. Continue reading to learn more about George Santo Pietro, the ex-husband of Vanna White.</p><h3>Here’s everything you need to know about Vanna White’s ex-husband George Santo Pietro</h3><p>For those of you who are not aware, let us inform you that George Santo Pietro, Vanna White’s ex-husband, owns a restaurant. In addition, he began his career as a film director before becoming an American real estate developer.</p><p>George was born on December 12, 1946, in Beverly Hills, California, according to his IMDB page. He is currently 76 years old. He has previously contributed to a number of movies, including Muppets Most Wanted, The Good Place, and Think Like A Man.<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/VannaWhite_GSP-scaled-e1632260743603-1536x1014-1-1024x676.jpg alt width=1024 height=676 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>George has contributed to numerous TV programmes during the course of his career as a film director, including L.A. The Big Bang Theory, Two And A Half Men, Alias, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, True Blood, Pushing Daisies, and Alias.</p><h3>When did Vanna White and George Santo Pietro tie the knot?</h3><p>In December 1990, Vanna White and George Santo Pietro exchanged vows. After 12 years of marriage, the two of them ended their relationship. In the year 2002, they separated.<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Vanna-White-John-Donaldson-embed-2-1-1.jpg alt width=620 height=731 sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Neither Vanna White nor her ex-husband George have revealed anything about their connection as of yet. The ex-couples were able to keep their relationship private back when there were no cameras around.</p><h3>How many kids do Vanna and George have?</h3><p>The ex-couple has a boy and a girl as their offspring. George, Vanna’s ex-husband, and their two children are proud parents. Sadly, Vanna miscarried soon after announcing that she and her then-husband George were expecting their first child together during a puzzle on Wheel in 1992.<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Vanna-White-daughter-family-1-1024x693.jpg alt width=1024 height=693 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Vanna stated, “Obviously I lost the baby, which was tragic after announcing it, in an interview with People magazine in 2019. The good news is that I was able to conceive again and gave birth to two gorgeous, healthy children. Losing a child, on the other hand, is never good.</p><p>Vanna never gave up. In 1994, she and her ex-husband George had Nicholas (better known by his moniker Niko), their first child together. Niko is 28 years old at the moment.</p><p>Nearly three years later, Santo Pietro and his ex-wife Vanna White welcomed their second kid. Giovanna, a daughter, was the second child born to Vanna and George in 1997. Gigi is 25 years old right now.</p><p>Vanna started dating Southern California businessman Michael Kaye after her divorce from George Santo Pietro. Although they were engaged, the couple never wed. Between 2004 and 2006, they dated for two years before calling it quits.</p><h3>Who is Vanna White dating right now?</h3><p>At the present, Vanna and John Donaldson are enjoying their partnership. Since they started dating in 2012, we must say that things are going rather well. In 2012, White and Donaldson first hung out together.</p><p>The game show host revealed her ideal date night with her beau John Donaldson in a 2019 interview with Closer Weekly, stating, “It would be a really basic supper with a bottle of wine. You know, at home or in a restaurant. Whenever I’m not in the kitchen! ”<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/e8684d34-6336-48ff-89fd-5825f83758d2-1.jpg alt width=670 height=523 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The couple appears to get along well. John Donaldson seems to get along well with Niko and Gigi, Vanna’s two children. White has shared a few images of herself with John and her adult children on the social networking site Instagram during the past couple of years.</p><p>Vanna gushed about her boyfriend John in a 2016 interview with Closer, saying, “He is kind, understanding, and allows me be me. I am content with how things are right now. How basic I actually live is perhaps what surprises my admirers the most.</p><h3>What does John Donaldson do for a living?</h3><p>John Donaldson works as a contractor. He has more than 30 years of experience in business. He is the proprietor of a contracting couple, which he founded in 1992 and formally incorporated in 1998, according to the official website of his firm.<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/the-hugely-successful-contractor-only-has-eyes-for-her-1621618640-1.jpg alt width=780 height=438 sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>John has built homes for several Hollywood celebrities, including Richard Dreyfuss and Dan Akroyd. He possesses a set of abilities that are suitable for a wide range of jobs.</p><p>According to his website, “For more than 20 years, JDC has been relied upon by individuals, families, and institutions throughout Southern and Northern California to complete a variety of residential property renovations, from custom single family homes to apartment communities ranging from 100 to 600 units.”</p><p>Do you believe that George Santo Pietro and Vanna White were not a good match for one another?
