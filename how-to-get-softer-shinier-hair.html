There's a secret to why this is — and it's so simple, so easy to do at home, that you're going to be overjoyed when you hear it (if not slightly embarrassed you lived this long without figuring it out on your own). And it's not about the way professionals cut your hair and it's not even their blowdry technique. It's so much more simple than that.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Let me set the scene. It's a sunny fall day in Chelsea and I'm being treated to a haircut by celebrity stylist and beauty expert <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nocaes">Clariss Rubenstein</a>, who's touched up the likes of Alison Brie, Sofia Vergara, Kat Dennings, and tons more. She's telling me about Monat haircare and how the brand's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nocaes nofollow">Replenish Masque</a> works great as a conditioner, and she's prepping my hair to dry as we chit-chat like old pals (we actually went to school together — small world!). She's giving me absolutely no Hollywood gossip no matter how hard I try, then, all of a sudden, she gets very serious. Almost glaring at me in the mirror she says, "You have to, have to, HAVE TO squeeze the water out of your hair before putting conditioner in. EVERY time."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And then she goes right back to being bubbly and fun, and showing me just how bouncy, shiny, and lively my hair is going to get when she's through. From that day forward I have heard Clariss's slightly threatening voice in my shower demanding that I thoroughly squeeze out my hair post-shampoo. Is it really that important? What difference could it possibly make? I called her up to get more information on this apparently crucial step I'd been missing for my almost four decades on this earth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Try to wipe something up with a soaking wet sponge," she says. "You're not absorbing anything. So if your hair is soaking wet, it's not able to absorb anything because it's completely full of water." Yes, okay, this makes perfect sense. Is this an every-time thing, or — "No exceptions. Or else."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are two reasons to squeeze your hair dry before conditioning, and the first and most obvious one is that if water prevents your conditioner from soaking into your hair, you're really just wasting your time and money every time you shower. "You've heard oil and water don't mix," Rubenstein explains. "If [your hair's] full of water, you're wasting your product, your money, and your hair isn't getting any benefits." But once you've squeezed? "Your hair absorbs all the nutrients, and [your conditioner] is a million times more effective than if you put it on soaking wet hair and everything's sliding out with the water."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: 5 Wet Hair Mistakes You Probably Didn't Realize You're Making</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">OK so how does someone who has such strong feelings about hair squeezing actually do it? Clariss explains the steps as follows:</p><li>Brush your hair back away from your face and gather it like a ponytail.</li><li>Squeeze downward from the base of the ponytail to the ends.</li><li>Repeat until water isn't dripping out anymore, so your hair is "as close to being not wet as possible."</li><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">An important note: Do not wring out your hair like laundry.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You want to avoid any unnecessary roughness that can lead to mechanical damage, i.e. breakage, which can happen by twisting and scrunching too aggressively, brushing, or even by twirling your hair up in a regular old towel post-wash (more on that in a minute).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As a new convert to the hair-squeeze method, I can assure you it does make a difference in how my hair absorbs conditioner, and how conditioned it feels after each wash. So simple! So easy! It costs zero dollars, and I am basically Alison Brie now by good-hair association! So I couldn't let Clariss off the phone without giving me the full treatment — by which I mean even more extremely easy-to-do tricks for softer hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's how she guarantees better hair with "maybe 45 seconds" of additional effort in the shower.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Shampoo as Infrequently as Possible</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lather, rinse, repeat? Not unless you really have to, when your hair is filthy dirty or your shampoo specifically calls for it. Clariss, a dry-shampoo evangelist, washes her hair about twice a week. "The less sensitizing you can do to the hair the better: the less mechanical damage, the less water." I ask if water temperature makes a difference. "Hot water is a bit more drying but I'm not gonna tell anybody to take a cold shower." Phew.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>She likes: </strong>"Anything <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Authentic Beauty Concept</a>.

Once or twice a week, you can use a hair mask instead of your regular conditioner (as a busy mom of two, she says she does this on her "longer, leg-shaving shower"). And the results are major: "As somebody who's been bleaching the ends of their hair for 15 to 20 years, I can tell you it makes a huge difference." She and I both swear by <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Davines</a> — the brand doesn't miss when it comes to <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>masks for any hair need</a>.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Comb or Brush While Wet</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There is one good use for water during your conditioning step, and it's rinsing while you comb. "I use a wide tooth comb or a gentle brush (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Sheila Stotts detangling brush</a> is great; the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Crown Affair wide tooth comb</a> is great; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Tangle Teezer</a> in the shower — all great options)," she says. "The water's kind of helping the knots slip out at the same time as I'm brushing, so that's less damage as well."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Invest in a Proper Hair Towel</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once again the name of the game is reducing damage and getting water out of the way. She recommends wrapping up with a hair-specific towel (think: microfiber) to avoid damage and allow your hair to gently dry itself while you go about your beauty routine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>She likes: </strong>Crown Affair, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>The Towel</a>, $45.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>No Matter Your Hair Type, You Should Be Using Detangler</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Clariss, detangler is the most slept-on haircare product, and we should all be using one. "You HAVE to use a detangler. Don't skip it. If your hair is fine, or if it's thick and coarse, it doesn't matter," she says. Detangler makes it possible to brush your hair without breaking it — and less damage means more softness and shine. "By nature, the ends of our hair are much dryer; they're older and they aren't close to where the head produces oil. Detangler on the mids and ends evens out <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the porosity of your hair</a>, so whatever product you're using after goes on evenly and works." From here on out: detangler from the ears down on freshly towel-dried hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>She likes:</strong> <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Unite 7Seconds Detangler</a>, $11</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Better Hair Is 45 Seconds Away</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bottom line? Clariss says it's all about getting your hair to "behave better" without wasting your precious time. (Did I mention she's a mom?) "The amount of time you're going to take — which is like 45 seconds between the squeezing of the hair, the mask, the detangler — your hair will probably perform 50 times better." So that's it. Wash infrequently, squeeze thoroughly, and condition like you mean it. Or, in Clariss's words, "If you're using your products properly, you'll like your hair better."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I'm sorry to be the one to tell you, it really is that simple.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x5qgq2eYpMRuwM5mnp6sXai8p8DEq2SsoJmjtqa%2BjKGYoqo%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-to-get-softer-shinier-hair.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-to-get-softer-shinier-hair.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-to-get-softer-shinier-hair.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-to-get-softer-shinier-hair.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-to-get-softer-shinier-hair.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-to-get-softer-shinier-hair.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./maria-dizzia-tv-actress-net-worth-233506.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./maria-dizzia-tv-actress-net-worth-233506.html>Maria Dizzia Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./nardo-wick.html>Who is Nardo Wick?
