He has been to the lowest point of his life, and now he lives like a king.</p><p>Just like any other rapper in showbiz, Lil Baby has a significant collection of wheels.</p><p>Let’s check them out.</p><h4>Dodge Challenger SRT Hell Cat</h4><p>The brand new version of this car costs about $60,000. He has been spotted in this particular car several times.</p><p>In 2018 he posed in front of Purple Hell Cat, and in 2019, he was seen posing in front of Orange one. There is every possibility that both the cars are the same and just went through some paint job.</p><p>This American muscle car has a supercharged 6.2-liter engine HEMI V8 engine that generates 707 brake horsepower.</p><p>The simple summary is it’s really fast and loud. In Baby’s words, if you’re a young black dude from the hood, you want to come to the hood on a car that’s loud and fast.</p><p>The car can boost to the top speed of 203 miles an hour and can go from 0-60 in 3.4 seconds.</p><h4>Lamborghini</h4><p>The rapper owns a couple of these Italian beasts, and one out of two is Urus. This luxury car lives up to the hype as the ultimate SUV as it’s extreme in every way.</p><p>It has a 4.0 liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine that pumps about 650 brake horsepower and 850-pound feet of torque. Similarly, Baby’s white Urus has a top speed of 190 miles per hour and can go from no 60 in 3.1 seconds.</p><p>This SUV set him back about $215,000.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lil-Baby-Urus.jpg><p>Similarly, the second Lamborghini in Lil Baby’s garage is the Lamborghini Aventador S Roadster which costs about $460,000. That’s really expensive, but Baby is rich enough to own one of these.</p><p>He really loves this car because of its lightning-fast speed. The car has a 6.5-liter V12 engine that generates 740 brake horsepower.</p><p>Similarly, the car has a top speed of 217 miles per hour and can go from 0-60 miles per hour in 2.9 seconds.</p><h4>Chevrolet Corvette C8</h4><p>Corvette C8 is a convertible that costs about $100,000. Baby has it in white color with blue interior and blue rims.</p><p>Of course, it comes a little cheaper at about $80,000, but it racks up to a 100 grand easy with Baby’s customization.</p><p>Nonetheless, it is a sleek car that features a carbon fiber body and a 6.2-liter V8 engine that generates 650 brake horsepower. It features every luxurious touch, which can easily make any car fanatic salivate.</p><p>Lil Baby has an automatic version of the car, which obviously costs a little extra. Interestingly he was arrested by Georgia Police for reckless driving in this particular car.</p><h4>Rolls Royce Cullinan</h4><p>This truck was a gift to the Baby from the CEO of his record label Quality Control Records. He got this white color Cullinan with a red interior for his 24th birthday.</p><p>It costs about $330,000. The SUV comes equipped with a 6.75 liters V12 engine that produces 563 brake horsepower and 627-pound feet of torque.</p><p>Despite its bulky size, it has a top speed of 155 miles per hour and can hit 60 miles in just 4.8 seconds.</p><h4>Mercedes</h4><p>Without a sleek Mercedes-Benz in a garage, is it even a car collection?</p><p>Lil Baby owns a couple of Benz’s and drives them when he feels like traveling in style.</p><p>First Mercedes in his collection is a rather decently priced convertible SLC 300. It is a two-seat retractable hardtop convertible that is not that expensive. Well, not for the Baby.</p><p>It costs about $50,000. The car uses a 3.0 liter twin-turbo V6 engine that produces 385 brake horsepower. Another Benz that Baby really admires is his blue G-Wagon.</p><p>He purchased the SUV and posted a picture of it on his gram with the caption My Dollars and Followers Match. His Mercedes-Benz AMG G 550 has a blue color and has 37 inches Forgiato Wheels. The SUV has a starting price of $150,000, and with some Lil Baby customization, it can go over a quarter million or even more.</p><p>Of course, these are not the wheels Lil Baby owns. If we do the math, he has certainly spend multi-millions on his wheels.</p><h3>Houses</h3><p>Reportedly, Lil Baby owns a massive mansion in Atlanta, Georgia. The exact location and specifications of the house have not been revealed yet. But as per one of his videos, It has an all-white interior with a grand staircase.</p><p>Outside of the house has a massive swimming pool with Spa and plenty of lounging places.</p><p>Similarly, Baby gifted a house to his mother and sister. In one of his interviews, he stated that he purchased a house for his mother, but he never lived in it.</p><h3>Watches and Jewelry</h3><p>Lil Baby’s watch collection includes a Rolex Date Just, Audemars Piguet, and many other Swiss timepieces.</p><p>His Rolex Date Just was a gift to him, but it did not have any diamonds when it was given to him. It holds a sentimental value to the Baby.</p><p>He would instead modify the same watch over and over again rather than go out buying one. It did not mention the actual figures, but he stated that he paid more for it because it has diamonds all over.</p><p>Similarly, he paid about $60,000 for his Skeleton Audemars Piguet watch.</p><p>Apart from that, he also owns Patek Philippe Nautilus.&nbsp; His Patek is nearly unrecognizable because of the number of diamonds studded on it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lil-Baby-Jewelry.jpg><p>Similarly, another expensive timepiece on his collection includes a Richard Mille 011 and Richard Mille 030.</p><p>Reportedly, NBA superstar James Harden gifted Baby RM 030, which costs about $150,000.</p><p>Similarly, another RM in his collection came as a gift from his girlfriend, Jayda Cheaves. This Richard Mille 011 coats about $200,000.</p><p>Apart from that, Lil Baby really loves his flashy jewelry. He is a big fan of Cuban Link bracelets, which he wears on both his wrists. These bracelets cost about $25,000 each.</p><p>He also loves his rings but loses them quite often. That’s why he has numerous rings in his jewelry box, with each one costing about $12000.</p><p>Similarly, Lil Baby’s chain collection has grown over the years.</p><p>His chains are worth about $15,000 each and pendants about $25,000 apiece.</p><p>However, the flashiest of all is his Lil baby Pendant which is actually a baby.
