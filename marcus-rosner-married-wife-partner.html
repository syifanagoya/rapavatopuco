However, the actor has successfully managed to keep his personal life out of the sights of people.</p><p>As a result, people are very much eager to learn the details of his love life and get to know if he is married to a wife or is dating a girlfriend.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rosner Is Currently Engaged to His Girlfriend</h2><p>Those who were wondering if the Canadian actor is married to a wife or not can be relieved to know that he is yet to share the wedding vows. However, he is going to settle down soon enough as he is already engaged to his long-time girlfriend.</p><p>Yes, you heard that correctly. On January 1, 2020, Rosner took to his Instagram handle to announce that he got engaged a day before on the 2020 New Years’ Eve.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>He had shared a black and white picture of him holding his girlfriend’s hand. In her ring finger, a big shining diamond engagement ring was clearly seen. In the caption, Rosner said, “In the midst of a life well-lived. #aboutlastnight #nye2020.”</p><p>On the same day, he <a href=# rel=noopener>posted</a> a small clip from their New Years’ Eve party following his proposal. The next day, he <a href=# rel=noopener>shared</a> another picture of him on his knees while he was about to propose to his soon-to-be wife.</p><p>The engaged duo <a href=# rel=noopener>began dating</a> around early or mid-2017. Since then, they have always been together. However, Rosner has never mentioned his partner’s name in the media or in his social media handles.</p><p>Due to that, there is no whereabouts about who Rosner’s fiance is. Furthermore, whenever he shares a picture alongside her, he usually hides her face using emojis or stickers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Engaged Duo Are Planning a New Years’ Eve Marriage</h2><p>The Campbell River, British Columbia native and his girlfriend are having some of the best moments of their life. And, it seems as if they have already made up their mind to walk down the aisle almost a year after being engaged.</p><p>In the past couple of months, the actor had been constantly sharing clips of his and his fiance’s vacation in Guatemala. In those clips, they could be seen visiting different places in Guatemala and relishing their time together.</p><p>Although it seems the two were just on a vacation, but as it turns out they were actually planning for their wedding. On an Instagram post of July 6, 2021, Rosner himself mentioned that he and his fiance spent the entire month of June in Guatemala planning their New Years’ Eve wedding.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The 32-year-old actor had shared a total of 7 clips in which the duo was seen paying visits to different places. In the seventh and last post, he <a href=# rel=noopener>revealed</a> the wedding planning team for his special day, I Do, Guatemala.</p><p>Well, going by that, it clearly looks like Rosner and his mysterious fiance have already chosen a place and date for the best moment of their lives. The place will be Guatemala and the date might be 2022 New Years’ Eve.</p><p>We wish the soon-to-be-married couple nothing but the absolute best. Perhaps, the actor might reveal the identity of his future wife after the wedding.</p><h1 class="mvp-post-title left">Late Actor Lance Reddick Had Great Relationship with His Wife and Two Kids</h1><span class="mvp-post-excerpt left"><p>Lance Reddick’s wife, Stephanie Reddick, is deeply saddened by his demise.</p></span><img width=1200 height=720 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lance-Reddick-Wife.jpg alt="Late Actor Lance Reddick Had Great Relationship with His Wife and Two Kids" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Late actor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lance Reddick</a> and his wife, Stephanie Reddick, shared a strong and enduring relationship, built on love and trust, spanning over two decades.</p><p>Lance met his wife in 1999 while he was working on a play at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota, whereas Stephanie was an employee there. The two quickly became close and developed a romantic connection, leading to a decade-long relationship.</p><p>Later, the couple eventually tied the knot in 2011 in a low-key ceremony at Bar Lurcat in Minneapolis, Stephanie’s home state. They also deliberately chose a single venue for both the ceremony and reception to simplify things for out-of-town guests.</p><p>During the wedding, the actor set only two <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">rules</a> for the celebration. The first rule was that everyone had to have fun, and the second was that Lance couldn’t see his wife’s wedding dress before she walked down the aisle.</p><p>Similarly, Stephanie embraced simplicity in her wedding preparations, allocating a modest $250 for her dress, which the actor personally picked up from the post office. She also chose floral arrangements for the dress details.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lance-Reddick-Wife.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Lance Reddick and his wife, Stephanie Reddick, were together for over two decades.

She suggested peonies because they were in season. I didn’t even know the flower color until the wedding day, and they turned out beautifully.”</p><p>Additionally, she fondly recalled her favorite moment as the day her mom saw her in the dress and moved to tears.</p><p>Although the couple openly shared details about their love story and wedding, they intentionally chose to keep the rest of their married life more private, valuing a sense of intimacy and personal space.</p><p>However, the actor and his wife made several red-carpet appearances together over the years, attending events such as premieres for movies like White House Down, The Blacklist, and Godzilla vs Kong.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>https://t.co/udSaRa6iKL</a> Lance Reddick's wife Stephanie Reddick pays tribute to late actor <a href=#>https://t.co/eqbLpMmEA0</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/crANvc7Nzv</a></p>— Film-News.co.uk (@FilmNewsWeb) <a href=# rel=noopener>March 19, 2023</a></figure><p>Now, following Lance’s untimely passing due to heart disease, his wife took a moment to connect with her late husband’s fans and express profound gratitude.

Later, on November 3, 2011, she passed away, marking a deeply sorrowful chapter in their lives.</p><p>After Suzanne’s passing, Lance candidly discussed the profound loss of his first wife and the mother of his two children in an interview with Strombo in 2012.</p><p>Reflecting on the impact of the tragedy, the actor emphasized, “It made me realize that I always have to keep in front of me why I’m doing this.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/couple.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Lance Reddick with one of his two children (Photo: Facebook)</p><p>Sharing the emotional weight of becoming his kids’ sole parent, he stated, “I felt it more with my ex-wife because suddenly I was my kids’ only parent… I have great kids, and it’s because they had a great mom.”</p><p>After his first wife’s passing, Lance and his second wife, Stephanie, continued to care for and raise his children, providing them with love and support.</p><h1 class="mvp-post-title left">Melissa Fumero Had Crush on Husband David Fumero Long before Wedding — Their Married Life</h1><span class="mvp-post-excerpt left"><p>Melissa Fumero and David Fumero have been together for more than a decade.</p></span><img width=1200 height=720 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Melissa-Fumero-Wedding.jpg alt="Melissa Fumero Had Crush on Husband David Fumero Long before Wedding — Their Married Life" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>American actress Melissa Fumero had a crush on her now-husband, David Fumero, ever since her teenage years, and little did she know at the time that one day, he would become her spouse.</p><p>When Melissa had a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">crush</a> on David, he was a young model who even made a brief cameo in Mariah Carey’s 1997 hit single ‘Honey.’ However, when the actress finally met David on the set of One Life to Live, she didn’t recognize him.</p><p>At that time, Melissa played the role of Adriana Cramer, while her now-beau appeared as Cristian Vega on the show.
