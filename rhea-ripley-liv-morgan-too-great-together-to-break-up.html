<time>06 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Despite only being aligned for a brief amount of time, WWE is already teasing a split between Rhea Ripley and <a href=#>Liv Morgan</a>, with the former apparently set to join Edge's new faction in the near future, but the company should rethink the move. The pair is way too good together, and have done nowhere near enough as a team.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=related-rhea-ripley-amp-liv-morgan-are-already-one-of-wwe-39-s-best-thrown-together-tag-teams><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Rhea Ripley & Liv Morgan Are Already One Of WWE's Best Thrown Together Tag Teams</a></span></h2><p>WWE should hold back on breaking the team up so quickly, and at least allow them to have a run in their struggling women's tag team division before sending them on their separate paths. Having only been paired up just before WrestleMania, there's still plenty left in the tank for the team, and while Ripley would be an excellent addition to Edge's stable, the potential they have as a tag team is too great to be pushed aside.</p><p>Too often WWE throws two random singles wrestlers together, and it doesn't quite work, but these two are great together, and there's no reason they should break up so shortly into their time as a team.</p><h2 id=it-adds-much-needed-depth-to-the-women-39-s-tag-team-division>It Adds Much Needed Depth To The Women's Tag Team Division</h2><p>Despite now being around for three years, WWE has made absolutely no attempt to <a href=#>strengthen their women's tag team division</a>, with there being literally zero actual teams in the division. Instead, the promotion continues to throw random singles wrestlers together, with the only real team to win the titles throughout its history being <a href=#>the IIconics</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IIconics-WWE-Womens-Tag-Team-Champions.jpg><p>Following their release in 2021, the division has been incredibly thin, with the champions more often than not being the only actual team in the company. Too often WWE just throw singles stars together just to challenge for the belts, before quickly breaking them up afterward again, but keeping Ripley and Morgan together will add much-needed depth to the division.</p><p>Just having an established tag team in the company would be a huge boost to the tag team division, and would make an eventual run with the titles mean much more if they've been paired up for a significant amount of time. Vince McMahon has continuously shown how little he cares for tag team wrestling, and it's even worse in the women's tag team division, but it's about time that changes, and keeping Ripley and Morgan together would be the first step in the right direction.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=it-gives-them-both-some-direction>It Gives Them Both Some Direction</h2><p>Another major reason for keeping the pair together is it finally gives both of the direction of their characters and gives them something to do going forward. While sure, if rumors are to be believed and <a href=#>Ripley</a> would split from Morgan to join Edge's group, it's unclear what would be next for Liv, and she's too damn talented to be left with nothing to do.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Rhea-Ripley-and-Liv-Morgan-make-their-entrance-at-WrestleMania-38-Cropped.jpg><p>Both women have seen their careers stalling on the main roster in recent months, with neither given all that much to do, despite how talented - and popular with audiences -they are, so keeping them together, and letting them reinvigorate the tag team division would add direction to their characters. It would help keep both feeling important, and stop them from falling out of favor with fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even if the run isn't as successful as one would hope, at least their time together would give both purposes for the time being.</p><h2 id=it-would-help-make-the-eventual-betrayal-mean-more>It Would Help Make The Eventual Betrayal Mean More</h2><p>With it being teased that Ripley will turn on Morgan soon, it's likely the betrayal will be portrayed as a major deal, with Ripley's heel turn a massive shock. The only problem is, the team hasn't been together long enough for fans to really care about their breakup.</p><p>rhea</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Liv-Morgan-and-Rhea-Ripley-together-Cropped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Keeping them together for a prolonged amount of time will only help to make their eventual split mean that much more somewhere down the line. It's routine for WWE to bring these teams together only to break them up shortly after, so it's hard for fans to really get invested in the teams or their eventual splits at all, but if Ripley and Morgan were aligned for quite some time, and the team managed to really endear themselves to WWE fans, the eventual breakup would mean so much more, and the heel turn that inevitably came from it would get off to a much more electric start.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>WWE Never Commits To Their Women's Tag Team Division</a></span></p><p>Factor in the excellent chemistry the two have shown together in their brief time teaming, and it's a no-brainer that WWE should keep them together for just a little longer, it's a shame Vince McMahon doesn't seem to see that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmeinbKiedGip6WdqWK5qsKMpqarn5GjerW7zmaeq52RqXq1u8aeq6GdomLBsHnBq5yao12qvXA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frhea-ripley-liv-morgan-too-great-together-to-break-up.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frhea-ripley-liv-morgan-too-great-together-to-break-up.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frhea-ripley-liv-morgan-too-great-together-to-break-up.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frhea-ripley-liv-morgan-too-great-together-to-break-up.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frhea-ripley-liv-morgan-too-great-together-to-break-up.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frhea-ripley-liv-morgan-too-great-together-to-break-up.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./50-cent-apologizes-megan-thee-stallion-jussie-smollett-meme.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./50-cent-apologizes-megan-thee-stallion-jussie-smollett-meme.html>50 Cent Apologizes To Megan Thee Stallion For Jussie Smollett Meme</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./mbongeni-ngema-accident.html>Mbongeni Ngema Accident, Is Mbongeni Ngema Still Alive or Dead?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./mbongeni-ngema-accident.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
