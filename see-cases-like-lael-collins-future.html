<time>28 Feb 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Thanks to the rookie wage scale, it is pretty much set in stone already what a player is going to be paid for the first 4-5 years of his NFL career. Should a player become a starter as a rookie like <a href=#>Russell Wilson</a> and excel, he is stuck getting paid nowhere near his value until&nbsp;his career is four years old (five if his option is picked up).</p><p>Dallas Cowboys offensive lineman La'el Collins is not going to have that problem. He was considered by many to be a first round pick (<a href=# title="Todd McShay Net Worth">Todd McShay</a> had him going at No. 11 and <a href=# title="Mel Kiper Net Worth">Mel Kiper</a> No. 16). Had he been picked where it&nbsp;was expected, he would be getting paid <strong>$10-13 million</strong> for the next four years – all of it guaranteed.</p><p>Instead, he is going to make just under <strong>$1.6 million</strong> over the next three years. Sounds like a raw deal, right? Especially since he wasn't drafted because he was a person of interest in the death of a pregnant woman with whom he had once been&nbsp;romantically involved. He was never a suspect, just someone the police wanted to talk to.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-197970 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/GettyImages-462687639.jpg alt=" La'el Collins" width=819 height=1024 sizes="(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-197970 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Al Messerschmidt/Getty Images)</p><p>That was enough for teams to drop him off of their draft boards. With the potential for a massive amount of negative publicity, plus a wasted pick if he were to go to jail, no one deemed him worthy of&nbsp;the risk.</p><p>While that had to suck, it couldn't have worked out better for Collins. Wait… What? Why?? How???</p><p>Well, not only was he able to control his destiny and choose where he wanted to play, but now he is going to get paid much sooner than his counterparts.</p><p>After three years, he will be a restricted free agent capable of entertaining offers from anyone, but the Cowboys would have the option to match. Should he be as good as expected, someone&nbsp;–&nbsp;if not the Cowboys&nbsp;–&nbsp;will pay him <strong>$10 million</strong> a season for the next 4-5 years.</p><p>Not a bad deal, right? He gets his big contract a year&nbsp;earlier&nbsp;(or two if the Cowboys decide to extend him a year earlier) and was able&nbsp;to choose which team he wanted to play for. It's a scenario most players would love, but can't have without suffering through a similar scenario.</p><p>So&nbsp;–&nbsp;could we see players become "persons of interest" around Draft Day in the future? It would be a gamble. They would either have to have people in on the scheme, which would be huge risk in itself, or have some shady friends that look just like them. It all depends on just how badly they want to control their own destiny.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjqycnmWTlsCmv4yloKSdXaGupriMnKalpJmjwG6y1K2sq51f</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsee-cases-like-lael-collins-future.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsee-cases-like-lael-collins-future.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsee-cases-like-lael-collins-future.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsee-cases-like-lael-collins-future.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsee-cases-like-lael-collins-future.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsee-cases-like-lael-collins-future.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./112716-missing-womans-body-found-shallow-grave-boyfriend-arrested.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./112716-missing-womans-body-found-shallow-grave-boyfriend-arrested.html>Missing Woman's Body Found in Shallow Grave 2 Days Later, Boyfriend and Friend Arrested</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./paul-rudd-reveals-his-secret-to-his-eternal-youth-sleep-then-diet-then-weights.html>Paul Rudd reveals his secret to his eternal youth: Sleep Then diet.
