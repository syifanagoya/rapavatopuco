Her parents started dating in the early 1960s. The two started dating and eventually got hitched in 1962.</p><p>Before divorcing in 1979, the husband and wife were married for 17 years. Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker have made their engagement public. The two children of the marriage, Susan and Amy, are their blessings. One of the two siblings, Amy Povich, is wed to David Agus at the moment.</p><h2><span id=Life_Following_Divorce>Life Following Divorce</span></h2><p>Her parents’ lives changed significantly after their divorce. Her mother first met her second love, Philip Baskin. They got hitched that year.</p><p>Shoshana Nudel and Janice Gondelman, their children from their marriage, are both women. Philip’s death tore the four-person family apart just as they were enjoying their perfect existence. Complications from Alzheimer’s led to Philip’s death in 2005.</p><p>Her stepmother, Maury, also moved on after their divorce. He subsequently started a new life by being married to news anchor and journalist Connie Chung. Before getting married in 1984, the pair had a lengthy courtship. They don’t have any of their kids.</p><p>They adopted a son named Matthew Jay Povich and raised him as their own. Maury was reluctant to get married because his first marriage didn’t work out. Throughout their relationship, he had been unfaithful to Connie numerous times. He had no desire to commit to a long-term union. He had so decided to adopt the tactic of neither asking nor telling his partner.</p><p>This was short-lived because Connie gave an ultimatum because she was tired of waiting. Their wedding ceremony caused a permanent impact on his life. He didn’t turn around, and his days of deceit were finished. His wife was able to convince him to remain faithful.</p><h2><span id=Red_Hook_Lobster_Pound_co-founder>Red Hook Lobster Pound co-founder</span></h2><p>She is really lucky to have her life partner as her business partner. The two returned from a family vacation in Maine with the concept for the business. They bought lobster from Portland pals. The lobsters she made, which they had brought, were excellent. It wasn’t pricey either. Then, her better half advised her to move to New York and open a lobster pound.</p><p>She had previously practiced law in the fields of music and technology. Susan enrolled in cooking classes since she had a similar interest in food. At the beginning of her career, she owned a restaur ant. She did, however, close it in a fit of annoyance. She has always loved to cook, and that love has never faded. Susan Anne Povicheventually started a food-related company in 2009 as a result.</p><h2><span id=Net_value>Net value</span></h2><p>She must have accumulated a substantial fortune through her business. As of December 2022, her father’s net worth is estimated to be $80 million, which he has accumulated from his job as a TV personality, newscaster, and former journalist.</p><p>His most well-known program is The Maury Povich Program. He makes $14 million a year in income.
