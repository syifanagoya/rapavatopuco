After so many years, people on the Internet want to know more about the man who killed them, Jeremiah Battle.</strong></p><p>Natasha Harner, who was 24 years old, and Kaliah Dearing, who was 16, were killed in their bedroom on November 9, 2017. In Harrisburg, there was a house where three sisters lived. A man named Jeremiah Battle broke in and killed two of them in their bedroom.</p><p>When the police asked him why, the man said that a broken windshield wiper was to blame. On the afternoon of November 9, 2017, Jeremiah Battle, who is said to be friends with the girls, says he went to their rental house in the 2200 block of Logan Street to ask them who was going to pay for his broken windshield wiper. From what he told the police, it got even worse after that.</p><p>Also, many family members went to the terrible accident site to add flowers, balloons, and stuffed animals to the memorial on the front porch. Here is everything you need to know about the terrible murder.</p><h2>Who was Harrisburg’s Kaliyah Dearing? When she was shot, was she pregnant?</h2><p>The youngest sister, Kaliyah Dearing, was the one who was shot and killed. She was a lovely woman with a powerful voice. But there is no proof that she was pregnant when she was killed by a gunshot. Kaliyah, Natasha, and a third sister who was probably in her late teens or early twenties lived in the same house when they were growing up.</p><p>Neighbors say that the third sister was the one who came home from work on Thursday at 5 p.m. and found her two sisters dead. Nobody knew how long they’d been dead.</p><p>Kaliah Dearing, who was 16 years old, was shot in the head, and Natasha Harner, who was 24 years old, was hurt in the head and arm. According to the transcript of his sentencing, Jeremiah Battle then moved and partially covered their bodies before taking two shot shells from the room and running away.</p><h2>Where is Jeremiah Battle at this moment?</h2><p>After the murder, Jeremiah Battle is still behind bars and serving his life sentence. In fact, he was given two life sentences in a row for killing two young sisters who were loved and cared for by many.</p><p>Jeremiah Battle, who was 23 years old at the time, pleaded guilty to murder and burglary for killing Kaliah Dearing and Natasha Harner in their Logan Street home on November 9. Judge Deborah E. Curcillo gave him a sentence of life in prison plus 20 years.</p><p>Battle did something that had never been done before: he pleaded guilty to killing, burglary, and tampering with evidence before he was properly arraigned, and he got the terms of his plea agreement right away.</p><h2>Why Did Jeremiah Battle Kill Harrisburg Sisters?</h2><p>Jeremiah Battle is the new friend that Kaliah and Harner have just made. He met them through friends they both had, and he would sometimes give them rides in his car. The person who did it said it was because the windshield wiper was broken.</p><p>But the victim’s mother thinks that there was more to the incident than just a windshield wiper. The main reason why the murder happened has not yet been found out. The day before the killings, Battle was at their rental house on Logan Street when Kaliah asked him to take her to the store. Tiana Seaton, who was with Kaliah at the time, said that he turned her down.</p><p>The next day, though, battle came to the house. A neighbor saw him at the front door. Court documents say that he either let himself in or forced his way in “with the intent to cause harm.” He found Kaliah and Harner in a bedroom on the second floor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrHDmpummpqisG%2B1zWiuoaddrK60ecqao6KxkZ16pbHAq6Cnn12bv7C5jKGYq6qZqK%2B2vsZo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-was-kaliyah-dearing-from-harrisburg.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-was-kaliyah-dearing-from-harrisburg.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-was-kaliyah-dearing-from-harrisburg.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-was-kaliyah-dearing-from-harrisburg.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-was-kaliyah-dearing-from-harrisburg.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-was-kaliyah-dearing-from-harrisburg.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./j-darius-bikoff.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./j-darius-bikoff.html>J.
