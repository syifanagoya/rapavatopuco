Andrew had already broken some franchise records for the Indianapolis Colts, and he had been to four Pro Bowls as well. He had had plenty of success, and was good enough that some have wondered whether he would <a href=#>make a comeback</a>.</p><p>Ultimately, though, it seems that Andrew is retired for good. Even years later, though, there are still plenty of people who wonder what Andrew's exact reasons were.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Andrew Luck retire?</h2><p>Andrew announced his retirement ahead of the 2019 season, and at the time, he cited his history of injuries as the primary reason for his decision.</p><p>"I've been stuck in this process. I haven't been able to live the life I want to live," he said at the time. "It's taken the joy out of this game. The only way forward for me is to remove myself from football. This is not an easy decision. It's the hardest decision of my life. But it is the right decision for me."</p><p>In an interview with ESPN from 2022, Andrew went into more detail about his decision, explaining that he went to extremes during his time in the league in part so that he felt like he had some control over the outcome. That meant getting involved with offensive schemes and becoming a sort of shadow coach for the team, and also simplifying his life so much that all he had was a flip phone.</p><p>"To play quarterback, you're not allowed to worry about anything except the task at hand," he explained. "And that seeps into other areas of life. It's not the healthiest way to live."</p><p>After injuring his shoulder in 2015, Andrew also explained that he played several seasons with the injury, even when both he and the Colts owner were assuring the public that he was perfectly healthy and ready to play.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Andrew added that his focus on recovery and football alienated him from his wife.</p><p>"There were some things that when I looked in the mirror, I did not like about myself," he said. "I was self-absorbed, withdrawn, in pain, and feeling pressure."</p><p>When Andrew injured his ankle in 2018 and began withdrawing into himself again, he realized that he didn't actually like playing football anymore.</p><p>Ultimately, Andrew said that he went to therapy and learned that he may never have perfect clarity on every aspect of his life. "I doubt I will ever find the answers," he said. "All of them. Or any answers."</p><p>In the years since his retirement, Andrew has surfaced occasionally, and it seems like he's much happier than he was while he was playing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2aZnpm%2FpsOMpayco12nsrW10Z4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-did-andrew-luck-retire.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-did-andrew-luck-retire.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-did-andrew-luck-retire.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-did-andrew-luck-retire.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-did-andrew-luck-retire.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-andrew-luck-retire.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dead-space-remake-differences.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dead-space-remake-differences.html>Top 9 Dead Space Remake Differences Discussed Here</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tamar-braxtons-lingerie-video-has-fans-talking-in-the-comments-but-david-adefeso-is-here-for-it-mamma-is-fine-391694.html>Tamar Braxtons Lingerie Video Has Fans Talking In The Comments, But David Adefeso Is Here For It:</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tamar-braxtons-lingerie-video-has-fans-talking-in-the-comments-but-david-adefeso-is-here-for-it-mamma-is-fine-391694.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
